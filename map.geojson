    "description":"This image can be found in the preface of the Bodleian library Shahnama manuscript. It is an Ink drawing that depicts a battle between what seems to be a phoenix and an Azhdaha, mythological creatures from ancient Iranian folklore and religion. The image is framed as having the two creatures in the center and juxtaposing one another. The reason this image was put in the preface to the Shahnama meant for Ibrahim Sultan is uncertain, but one potential theory is that it was meant to provide a deeper insight and understanding of the creatures that appear in the Shahnama. Both creatures appear in the Shahnama, as Simurgh, the legendary phoenix that is given pity by god to take care of Zal. And the Azhdaha who attempts to attack Rustam in his sleep, but is found out and slain by Rustam and his horse Rakhsh. Although both the creatures in the image appear in the Shahnama in one form or another, neither are found within the same scene lending credence to the theory that the preliminary material is meant for understanding some of the history and symbolic meaning of the creatures in the story. Ibrahim Sultan, the patron and governor of Shiraz at this time, was a great admirer of the arts and was a calligrapher."},

    "description":"The Azhdaha is most often described and visualized as a sort of snake-like dragon. It dates back to pre-Islamic Zoroastrianism to which it was then called “Aži Dahaka'', meaning something likened to “Dragon-King.” The Aži Dahaka was described as having 3 heads and 6 eyes(Foundation1, 2011). Dragons and different depictions of them, can be found dating back to 2700BC in Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian mythologies(Lessons Editor, 2019). It is possible that a common root exists, but the Azhdaha depicted in this image most closely resembles a Chinese dragon than that of many other depictions. The chinese dragon is often depicted as snake-like and can walk on clouds having 4 legs. This very closely resembles the Iranian myth of the Azhdaha, who is described as being gigantic and snake-like with wings. but the cultural role that the Azhdaha plays is very different from Long, the Chinese counterpart. Long being a symbol of good and the emperor, the counterpart to the Chinese phoenix Fenghuang who was a symbol of the empress. The Azhdaha on the other hand is most often associated with destruction and drought much more similar to the Aži Dahaka of Zoroastrianism(Foundation1, 2011). This image potentially exemplifies a mixture of culture bringing Persian meaning to Chinese imagery. This could even be a plausible theory based upon the heavy amounts of culture mixing that was taking place during this time(UNESCO, N/A)."},

    "description":"Simurgh is an ancient pre-Islamic mythical bird who has roots in the oral traditions of early Zoroastrianism. Simurgh, then referred to as Saêna, was said to have a nest within a tree that holds the seeds of all plants and sits within the middle of the sea(Schmidt, 2002). It is possible that Feng, mythical and ancient Chinese phoenix that dates back to up to 8000 years ago, has some relationship with the emergence of what would come to be Simurgh. At the very least, around the 14th century Chinoiserie art motifs can be found in Persian culture in a form that draws upon the history of Simurgh that had already existed, as well as the then, modern Chinese art. The result is motifs that have been integrated to more closely reflect the Persian context for the symbols rather than the Chinese(Sheikh, 2017, 1). Simurgh also was adapted into the Persian epic the Shahnama sometime around the 10th century, playing a parental role to Zal and providing him nourishment. The depictions of Simurgh in manuscripts of the Shahnama often depict a phoenix-like creature with little resemblance of its original description of having a dog or human face and the claws of a lion. This can potentially exemplify a change in how Simurgh was imagined with time. The Shah Tahmasp Shahnama manuscript is possibly the most famous example exemplifying a Simurgh which lacks some of the defining features of traditional Simurgh showing a difference of imagination when compared to more ancient imaginations."},

    "description":"A dragon in Persian or Iranian literature and tradition is often an antagonist to heroes or the good. While Simurgh is often seen as a symbol of the divine. Chinese literature and image often depicts the two together but it is found less often in Persian and Iranian lore. This could be due to the different meanings that were traditionally attached to the images and symbols. The image here depicts the Azhdaha and Simurgh together, possibly being a Chinese influence. But the battle is uncommon for Chinese symbolism so it is likely that the Simurgh symbol is being used in a relatively novel way. There are numerous stories of heroes fighting dragons, one of which is even within the Shahnama, this thematically gives the Simurgh parallels to the hero archetype representing the ageless theme of good vs evil."},

    "description":"Both the phoenix and the dragon existed in Iranian folklore and religion before any known Chinese influence on the region. But Chinoiserie motifs began emerging sometime around the 13th-14th century, landing very close to the dating of this image which is sometime between 1420-1440(Hillenbrand, 2003). Furthermore the Phoenix(Fenghuang), and the Dragon(Long), can very often be found juxtaposing one another in image and sculpture in Chinese imagery(cite). The Chinese representations of these symbols are often likened to Yin and Yang, virtue and strength, or the emperor and the empress. The antithetical yet unionized nature of the Yin-Yang can be found in the image depicted here, but the Chinese symbols are very rarely if never found in battle with oneanother. The battle of opposition depicted here is more likely to be the Iranian influence on Chinese motifs, taking creatures that are much more similar in outward appearance to Chinese mythology than ancient Persian or Iranian. Yet giving them the twist and nature of Iranian creatures that had already existed before Chinese influence. In Iranian folklore and pre-Islamic Zoroastrianism, the Azhdaha was typically a representation of an evil or destructive force, while the Simurgh, a representation of the divine(Foundation2, 2011). Interestingly this does not seem to be in conflict with the Chinese interpretations of Fenghuang and Long being Yin and Yang. The artist depicting this battle seemed to have been able to translate the Chinese symbols and interpret them in such a way to allow Iranian folklore to speak through, all while remaining true to its influence."},

    "description":"Simorgh is a symbolic representation of the divine(Schmidt, 2002), and the Azhdaha is symbolic of destruction(Foundation1, 2011). In Chinese tradition and symbolism, oftentimes Fenghuang and the Long(dragon) are representations of yin and yang, or the emperor and empress. The Chinese symbols are very rarely if ever found locked in combat and are seen more often as complimentary yet equal opposites. The creatures in this image, although in outward appearance resemble traditional Chinese symbols and less Zoroastrian or Iranian, in symbolic meaning express something much more closely related to the Zoroastrian and Iranian folklore. This is represented in the battle between the divine force that Simurgh represents and the more evil and destructive force that the Azhdaha represents. These two symbols are not in a state of contention or at odds with one another in Chinese symbolic gesture and instead in a state of balance and harmony. Interestingly both battle and harmony can correctly be interpreted from the Chinese Yin-Yang symbol of which they are commonly representational of. So while in China these two forces are typically in a sort of marriage and union, in Iranian lore it is an interlocked battle between good and evil destruction and the divine. The dominance of the Azhdaha in this particular scene if viewed symbolically would then be representational of evils overpowering over good. This is further exemplified by the skewed proportion of the Azhdaha when compared to the Simurgh which is smaller in comparison. The Yin-Yang in this image is thus being dominated by the light, further lending credence to this idea of deeper symbolic significance. The coloration of the two creatures is also of note due to Chinese symbols typically representing Yin(black) as the dragon and Yang(white) as the phoenix."},

    "description":"The image depicts a battle that seems to be taking place in the sky. The wind that can be seen at the top of the image as well as the clouds that the Azhdaha can be seen walking atop is what tells the viewer of the location. Furthermore, the Azhdaha can be seen with 4 legs, no wings, and a serpent like body which are all parallels to the Chinese dragon. Simorgh interestingly also is depicted as having 3 reatrices which is a common motif that Fenghuang embodies. The Azhdaha in this image seems to be the more dominant force depicted in its handling of the Simurghs tail and devouring of Simurghs head. The overpowering of Simurgh is also shown in the expression of the Azhdaha which seems joyous, as well as the imbalanced size ratio comparing the two creatures. The image is stylistically drawn very differently than the rest of the Bodleian Shahnama, potentially hinting at a different artist. This is further supported as the preliminary material in general represents a different style than the rest of the Shahnama. Simurghs tail seems to also be aflame, depicted in the shape and lack of texture when compared to the rest of the body. This, if correct, could almost be seen as a parallel to the Greek phoenix who was an immortal divine bird which repeatedly died aflame and rose from the ashes."},
